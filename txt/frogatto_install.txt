Ubuntu, so look there: https://github.com/frogatto/frogatto/wiki/Compiling-Frogatto-on-Debian

clone anura and frogatto (takes long),
put frogatto into anura/modules/

when installing the dependencies, remove that libboost-filesystem-dev because it says errors
(libboost-filesystem-dev : depends on: libboost-filesystem1.54-dev but shouldnt be installed)

if you don't have it yet, add following line to ~/.bashrc
alias mache='make -j $(nproc || sysctl -n hw.ncpu || echo 2)'
it's from freeminer, it automatically detects core counts

cd into anura/ and run $ mache
