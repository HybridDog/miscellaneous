[Mod] Fire extinguisher [extinguisher]

Hold LMB to spray foam, which disallowes fire next to it like water does
Place the extinguisher next to fire and punch it with a torch to let it explode, replace all flames with foam nodes and replace the placed extinguisher with a broken one which drops stuff of the craft recipe
This mod makes poisonivy useful for something and it isn't the first mod adding a fire extinguisher.

[Mod] Word Translation [word_translation]

The Word Translation mod translates each word of item descriptions (if the word is available) (words seperated by " ") and currently only supports one language.
But it's compatible with the other known translation mods (vortoj, intllib) and is able to translate whole description strings instead of each of their words, too.

[Mod] Small Paths [small_paths]

This mod didn't work correctly but it doesn't cause lag and I think it's a bit decorative.

[Mod] PilzAdam's builtin_item mod reworked [builtin_item]

I edited [url=https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=3188]PilzAdam's builtin_item mod[/url] that it doesn't override the whole item and so it supports the newest item definition.
Using this one instead of PilzAdam's version together with the item_drop mod fixes the double pick up cheat but it also requires a new item_drop mod (else you aren't able to drop items):
https://github.com/HybridDog/zegaton_game/tree/master/mods/item_drop

I changed a bit the behaviour of items being moved by water too, test it if you want to know the differences.

[Mod] A mod adding a way to give players interact. [rulesaccept]

This mod allows players to get interact if they didn't already get interact in this way before and slowly read the rules and accept them.
Of course the players are informed about this way to get interact automatically.
I used the [url=http://minetest.web1337.net/rules.php]rules of zegaton[/url] as default values.

[b]License:[/b] WTFPL (except the default rules)

By default, so it looks like if the rules are viewed with interact.

[Mod] Teleport bugfix [stay_inside]

Before I never had this problem.
This simple mod teleports players back to their previous position if they're too far outside of the map.

[Mod] Nodebox Creator [nodebox_creator]

The nodebox generator was too … for me, so I made this mod, where I can change them by using the keyboard.
This mod adds a node (not craftable) where someone can write coords of nodeboxes inside.
Nodeboxes can be imported (by pasting it into the multiline text field which currently only works on windows, I think) and exported.

Its nodebox is made with a nodebox creator node.

[Mod] nodes spawning houses [home_builder]

This mod is fairly unfinished.
It adds nodes which are used to build houses which can't be made by just placing a schematic, automatically.
Change the nodes being used for the houses by using keys together and clicking on the ones you want.
Currently it supports "Huts", which I often build (the reason for being not yet finished), and I often try to fix problems. Now (20140929) I need to fix the function which removes unwanted positions from a table.
